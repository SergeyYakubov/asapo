title: Message query
---


import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

Messages in streams can be retrieved based on their metadata. Both the technical information (e.g. ID or timestamp) and the user metadata (see [this tutorial](metadata) for details) can be used to make a query. In this tutorial several examples of the queries are shown. The standard SQL sysntaxis is used.

Only the query-relevant parts would be explained here. Look at the corresponding examples to learn about producers and consumers in detailes.

<Tabs
  groupId="language"
  defaultValue="python"
  values={[
    { label: 'Python', value: 'python', },
    { label: 'C++', value: 'cpp', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="python">

```python content="./examples/python/query.py"
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="cpp">

```cpp content="./examples/cpp/query.cpp"
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The output will show the message selection together with the conditions used for selection.
