The consumer and a producer could be combined together in order to create pipelines. Look at the corresponding examples to learn about producers and consumers in detailes. Only the pipeline-related things will be explained here.

<Tabs
  groupId="language"
  defaultValue="python"
  values={[
    { label: 'Python', value: 'python', },
    { label: 'C++', value: 'cpp', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="python">

```python content="./examples/python/pipeline.py"
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="cpp">

```cpp content="./examples/cpp/pipeline.cpp"
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The details about the received message should appear in the logs, together with the message "stream finished" (if the "finished" flag was sent for the stream). The "stream ended" message will appear for non-finished streams, but may also mean that the stream does not exist (or was deleted). The processed file should appear in the corresponding folder (by default in ```/var/tmp/asapo/global_shared/data/test_facility/gpfs/test/2019/data/asapo_test```)
