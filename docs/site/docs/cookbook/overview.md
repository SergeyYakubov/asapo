title: Code Examples Overview
---

Here you can find the code examples for various common asapo usecases. Make sure that the ASAP::O instance and client libraries are properly installed, see [Getting Started page](../) for details.

For the most basic usecase, see the [Simple Producer](simple-producer) and [Simple Consumer](simple-consumer). There are also the basic examples of CMake and makefile configurations for client compilation.

The API documentation can be found [here](http://asapo.desy.de/cpp) (for C++) or [here](http://asapo.desy.de/python) (for python).
