title: Acknowledgements

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

While consuming the messages we could issue acknowledgements, to denote that the messages were (or were not) processed successfully.

Here is the snippet that expects 10 sample messages in the default stream. When consuming the messages, the message #3 receives a negative acknowledgement, which puts is back in the stream for the repeated processing, and the messages 5 and 7 remain unacknowledged. On the second attempt the message #3 gets acknowledged.

You can found the full example in git repository.

<Tabs
  groupId="language"
  defaultValue="python"
  values={[
    { label: 'Python', value: 'python', },
    { label: 'C++', value: 'cpp', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="python">

```python content="./examples/python/acknowledgements.py" snippetTag="consume"
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="cpp">

```cpp content="./examples/cpp/acknowledgements.cpp" snippetTag="consume"
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The list of unacknowledged messages can be accessed at any time. This snippet prints the list of unacknowledged messages.

<Tabs
  groupId="language"
  defaultValue="python"
  values={[
    { label: 'Python', value: 'python', },
    { label: 'C++', value: 'cpp', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="python">

```python content="./examples/python/acknowledgements.py" snippetTag="print"
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="cpp">

```cpp content="./examples/cpp/acknowledgements.cpp" snippetTag="print"
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The output will show the order in which the messages receive their acknowledgements. You may notice that the second acknowledgement of the message #3 happens with a delay, which was deliberatly chosen. The unacknowledged messages are retrieved separately at the end, after the consumer timeout.
