title: Acknowledgements
---


import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

While consuming the messages we could issue acknowledgements, to denote that the messages were (or were not) processed successfully.

The following example produces 10 sample messages, and then acknowledges all of them, except for the messages 3, 5 and 7. The message #3 receives a negative acknowledgement, which puts is back in the stream for the repeated processing. On the second attempt the message #3 gets acknowledged. The messages 5 and 7 remain unacknowledged.

Only the acknowledgements-relevant parts would be explained here. Look at the corresponding examples to learn about producers and consumers in detailes.

<Tabs
  groupId="language"
  defaultValue="python"
  values={[
    { label: 'Python', value: 'python', },
    { label: 'C++', value: 'cpp', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="python">

```python content="./examples/python/acknowledgements.py"
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="cpp">

```cpp content="./examples/cpp/acknowledgements.cpp"
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The output will show the order in which the messages receive their acknowledgements. You may notice that the second acknowledgement of the message #3 happens with a delay, which was deliberatly chosen. The unacknowledged messages are retrieved separately at the end, after the consumer timeout.
