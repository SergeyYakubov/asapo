#Changelog for version 22.03.0

FEATURES
* Monitoring: Added detailed monitoring and pipeline visualization
* Consumer API: return kDataNotInCache/AsapoDataNotInCacheError error if data is not in cache and cannot be on disk (due to the ingest mode producer used)

IMPROVEMENTS
* renamed and hid C++ macros from client code

BUG FIXES
* Producer API: fixed bug segfault in Python code when sending data object which memory is from some other object

VERSION COMPATIBILITY
* Previous C consumer & producer clients will break due to two extra parameters for instance id and pipeline step id in *asapo_create_source_credentials*.

INTERNAL
* Do not return error when receiver cannot get slot in shared cache - just allocate own memory slot
